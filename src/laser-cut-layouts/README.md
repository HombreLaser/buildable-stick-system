# Layouts to laser cut: intended as top panels

You can easily generate these with both openscad and librecad: open the scad file pertaining to the left
panel you like (a lever or the left half of a hitbox layout for example), generate its 
[projection](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/3D_to_2D_Projection) and then export it
to dxf. Do these for both halves of the 3D printed top panel.

Then, open them in a program like librecad: copy one onto the other, delete the dividing line between them
and any unneeded screws, like those of the lever.
